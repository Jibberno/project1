            Jibberno started off his journey as a Madness animator around 2019, and with all the free time he could
            muster up he finally made his own short for Madness Day 2020. This short would garner around 500k views on
            Youtube, which surprised him that it popped off in the first place.

            However his life wasn't entirely related to Madness and 2d animation in general. He started off as a 3d
            modeller for Roblox under another name, where instead of violent cartoons he modeled Thomas The Tank Engine
            Characters.
